                          MathFactLab was created by Mike Kenny, a working
                          fifth-grade math, science and social studies teacher.
                          The idea for MathFactLab sprang from a master’s
                          project completed when he was a student in the Vermont
                          Mathematics Initiative.

                        <p className="bullet-item">
                          He had been frustrated by the absence of any
                          commercially-available math fact program that actually
                          aligned with the research, so, for his project, he
                          developed a large set of strategy-based flashcards for
                          his students to use as they practiced their math
                          facts.
                        </p>
                        <p className="bullet-item">
                          As there were so many flashcards, the students
                          struggled to keep the sets organized in a way that was
                          effective, so Mike eventually moved the program online
                          using Google Slideshows. This made a huge improvement
                          and Mike began to truly see the effectiveness of
                          providing a range of strategies for students to
                          develop true math fact fluency.
                        </p>
                        <p className="bullet-item">
                          Google Slides, however, lacked the interactivity and
                          memory of a true webapp, so after seeing first hand
                          the potential of this strategy-based approach, Mike
                          began the long process of building a website, with the
                          hope that this approach could be used not only by his
                          students and those in his school, but by students
                          around the world.

                          For example, the fluency rate setting, by default, is

                          adjusted down to 2 seconds or up to 120 seconds

                          First, let’s define ‘math fact fluency’. Fact fluency
                          is not automatic recall, although students who are
                          fluent with the basic facts will most likely have
                          automatic recall for most or all facts, but not
                          necessarily.

                        <p className="bullet-item">
                          If you ask a student who is fluent with the
                          multiplication facts what is ‘6 x 8’, she might not be
                          able to say, ‘48’ instantly, without thought. However,
                          she will be able to figure it out within a couple
                          seconds and tell you multiple ways she could have
                          solved it: double 3 x 8, double 4 x 6, add one more
                          eight to five eights, etc.
                        </p>
                        <p className="bullet-item">
                          Likewise, she could tell you that 7 + 8 is one more
                          than double 7, one less than double 8, or 7 + 3 + 5.
                        </p>
                        <p className="bullet-item">
                          Automaticity through memorization has no depth of
                          understanding to it; like learning to identify words
                          without knowing letter sounds. Nor is long-lasting. If
                          math fact knowledge is based on memorization, it’s
                          likely to fade over time.

                          We believe that rote memorization through drill
                          encourages students to think of math as a mess of
                          discrete factoids. In our view, it’s one reason why
                          there is so much adult mathematics illiteracy.

                          and levels of the program. At each level, students can
                          see the exact fact triangles that they are focusing on
                          at their particular level. This way students are fully
                          aware of the day’s learning targets, and can see by
                          the generally small amount of fact triangles at any

                          can multiply, they can divide. They just haven’t

                          MathFactLab has multiple strategies particularly
                          designed to help students see the relationships of the
                          inverse operations. On some strategies, students are
                          simultaneously adding and subtracting. While on others
                          they are dividing and multiplying at the same time.
                          Mathematics is the art of pattern hunting. The more
                          patterns our students see, the less complicated and
                          the more comprehensible the world of mathematics
                          becomes. When students see the relationship of the
                          inverse operations, they realize that there is so much
                          less to learn.

                        Most of the math fact websites you will find on the
                        internet quiz students on the basic facts in one way or
                        another without providing them a strategic means to
                        solving the basic facts. This is drill.

                        If a student cannot respond accurately to a fact prompt,
                        such as 6x7, these websites will not suggest that the
                        student uses their knowledge of 3x7 and double it or add
                        another seven to 5x7. Rather, it will just tell the
                        student that the product is 42, and encourage them to
                        memorize this fact. Drill only makes sense if students
                        already have a very solid foundation with the facts and
                        are simply working to increase their response time. Even
                        then, it’s not a particularly good choice.

                        Our basic multiplication and division program has eleven
                        levels, which proceed in a research-based order.
                        Students begin with the foundational facts: x2, x10, x5,
                        x1, x0. With that solid foundation, students are then
                        ready to construct the derived facts, which students
                        proceed through in the following order: x4, x3, x6, x9,
                        x8, and x7.

                        The primary models used with division are number lines,
                        area models, and bar diagrams.

                        mode teaches the x2 facts. We harness student prior
                        knowledge of doubling to make for an easy start to our
                        multiplication program.
