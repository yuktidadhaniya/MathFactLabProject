          This year, in class, students are using MathFactLab to practice and
          learn the basic math facts (for example, 7 + 5, 14 - 9, 6 x 8, or 32 รท
          4). What we particularly like about this program is that problems are
          represented visually and students are given strategies to solve them.{" "}

          Regular practice at home with MathFactLab will lead to improved math
